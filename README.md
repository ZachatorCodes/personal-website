# Zach Schwartz's Personal Website

This website was created to serve as a portfolio site for myself. Everything on the site is created with code, using multiple different front-end libraries.

## Tech Stack
This website was created with a few different technologies
* Vite - v7.1.2 (Build Tool)
* React - v19.1.1 (Frontend Library)
* DaisyUI - v5.0.50 (Frontend Style Library)
* TailwindCSS - v4.1.12 (CSS Style Library)
* React Router - v7.8.2 (Frontend Routing)
* GitHub Pages - v6.3.0 (Site Hosting)

## External Code
This website was creating using external code in order to allow hosting and front-end routing on GitHub Pages for a single-page web application.
Thank you to [Rafael Pedicini](https://github.com/rafgraph) for figuring out this work-around!
